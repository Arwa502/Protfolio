            <h3>Hello, Meet Me</h3>
            <h1>Arwa Bharmal</h1>
            <h3>And I'm a <span>Frontend Developer</span> </h3>
            <p>Welcome to my world of possibilities! A fresh graduate with a diverse skill set, I'm not just an 
                Electrical Engineer, but also an adept Frontend Developer and a dynamic Product Manager. My journey
                 at Habib University was a captivating blend of circuits, hardware, and the thrilling world of 
                 robotics. This experience granted me a deep understanding of technical intricacies. Curiosity led 
                 me to frontend development, where I've crafted seamless digital experiences. With a liberal arts 
                 background, I've honed skills in Product Management, infused with design thinking and a 
                 system-focused approach. Now, I'm eagerly poised to take on new challenges and bring value to 
                 projects aligned with my versatile skill set</p>
